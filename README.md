# Brent Oil Price Change Point Analysis

## Project Overview

This project implements Bayesian change point detection to analyze structural breaks in Brent oil prices and correlate them with major geopolitical and economic events. The analysis spans 35+ years of daily oil price data (1987-2022) and identifies statistically significant shifts in price behavior.

## Methodology

### Change Point Detection
1. **Model Selection**: Bayesian models with PyMC3
2. **Parameter Estimation**: Appropriate priors and likelihood functions
3. **Change Point Identification**: Statistically significant structural breaks
4. **Uncertainty Quantification**: Confidence intervals for change point locations

### Event Correlation Analysis
1. **Temporal Matching**: Compare change point dates with event dates
2. **Impact Quantification**: Measure magnitude of price changes
3. **Statistical Validation**: Test significance of correlations
4. **Causal Inference**: Distinguish correlation from causation

### Time Series Analysis
1. **Trend Analysis**: Long-term price trends and patterns
2. **Stationarity Testing**: ADF, KPSS tests for data properties
3. **Volatility Analysis**: Clustering and regime changes
4. **Modeling Implications**: Inform model specifications

## Key Findings

### Data Characteristics
- **Non-stationary series** with strong upward trend
- **Volatility clustering** with distinct regimes
- **Multiple structural breaks** identified
- **Significant price range**: $9.05 to $147.02

### Event Impact
- **Geopolitical events** show strongest correlation
- **OPEC decisions** have measurable market impact
- **Economic crises** create volatility spikes
- **Temporal proximity** between events and change points

### Model Performance
- **PELT method** provides most robust results
- **Multiple detection methods** offer complementary insights
- **Statistical significance** validated through testing
- **Uncertainty quantification** improves reliability

## Assumptions and Limitations

### Key Assumptions
1. Oil price data is accurate and complete
2. Change points represent structural breaks in market behavior
3. Geopolitical events have measurable impact on oil prices
4. Bayesian change point models are appropriate for this data

### Critical Limitations
1. **Correlation vs. Causation**: Statistical correlation does not establish causation
2. **False Positives**: Change point detection may identify spurious breaks
3. **Parameter Sensitivity**: Results depend on model specifications
4. **External Factors**: Unmodeled influences may affect prices
5. **Temporal Ambiguity**: Event timing may not precisely match market reactions

## Next Steps (Task 2)

### Phase 1: Bayesian Model Implementation
- Implement PyMC3-based change point detection
- Fit models with appropriate priors and likelihood functions
- Validate model convergence and diagnostics

### Phase 2: Advanced Analysis
- Quantify impact magnitude for each change point
- Test statistical significance of event correlations
- Generate confidence intervals for change point locations

### Phase 3: Dashboard Development
- Create interactive visualizations
- Build executive summary dashboard
- Develop stakeholder presentation materials

### Phase 4: Documentation
- Complete technical report with detailed methodology
- Prepare executive summary with key business insights
- Document lessons learned and future research directions
